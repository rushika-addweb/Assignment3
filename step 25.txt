In this step 25  we have to use the the laravel  framework 

The laravel is used  in making webpages first we need to download composer from broweser then we we can download the laravel from 

composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/project-name

then we can start server by   php artisan serve


then it will download with all the necssary packages and files i.e

Public Directory


Configuration Files


Directory Permissions


Application Key


Additional Configuration

Cache
Database
Session

Web Server Configuration

Directory Configuration


Pretty URLs
Apache
Laravel includes a public/.htaccess file that is used to provide URLs without the index.php front controller in the path. Before serving Laravel with Apache, be sure to enable the mod_rewrite module so the .htaccess file will be honored by the server.

 Then we can make changes in env file to call database and model , controller, routes ,views can start our laravel project now .
